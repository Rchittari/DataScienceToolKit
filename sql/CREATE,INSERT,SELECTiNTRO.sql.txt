###What are your favorite books? You can make a database table to store them in! In this first step, create a table to store your list of books. It should have columns for id, name, and rating.##

create table books(id integer,name text,rating integer);

INSERT INTO books VALUES (1,'rAASH',5);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2,'GOAT',4);
INSERT INTO books VALUES  (3,'RRRRR',3.5);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (4,'MOVIES',5);


###Now, add a second query after the first, that retrieves only the movies that were released in the year 2000 or later, not before. Sort the results so that the earlier movies are listed first. You should have 2 SELECT statements after this step.###

CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, release_year INTEGER);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, "Avatar", 2009);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, "Titanic", 1997);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope", 1977);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "Shrek 2", 2004);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, "The Lion King", 1994);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (6, "Disney's Up", 2009);
 

SELECT * FROM MOVIES;
SELECT * FROM MOVIES WHERE RELEASE_YEAR >2000 ORDER BY RELEASE_YEAR ASC;
